1. Configure Dcm Dsl protocol ID to be over CAN and configure the protocol priority.
2. Configure the service table.
3. activate the operation cycle in DEM.
4. create and configure an event for voltage monitoring, and refernence what needed for configration
    - DTC reference
    - Operation Cycle reference
    - Freeze Frame Class reference, etc.
5. configure the failure threshold=4 in event debouncing configrations and othe debouncing configrations: 
    - FDC INC. step size
    - FDC DEC. step size
    - passed threshold
    - jump down
    - jump up
    - confirmed threshold, etc.
6. configure freeze frame for temperature( define the DID and Data Element)
7. configure a DTC= 0x777919
8. Reference the DTC in the voltage monitoring event as mentioned in step 4
